                <p class="textblock" >As the resulting 2016 report rightly pointed out, this is a 
                cautious investigation since, “Quantifying diversity in labor markets is an inherently 
                fraught pursuit, in part because our techniques for recording this data, our nomenclature,
                    our definitions must be necessarily blunt in order to reduce the richness of characteristics 
                    we use to categorize ourselves and others (race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, 
                    to name only a few) into discrete categories." These
                    charts here are likewise cautiously drawn. In order to approximate museums similar 
                    to those on the city's Cultural Institutions Group, those classified as museums that 
                    have budgets of $999,999+ (in order to select what may more typically
                    be thought of as a museum with collections of works, a building and staff who look 
                    after the collection) are depicted.<br> The NYC DCLA publicly available dataset, 
                    with the "Diversity in the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs
                    Community" survey findings from Ithaka S+R and funding partner, The Andrew W. Mellon 
                    Foundation, had a big impact on the city’s cultural community. Following the report, 
                    the DCLA initiated a cultural plan, reaching out to “nearly 200,000
                    New York City residents, from every corner of the city,” to hear priorities, concerns, 
                    and ideas from local residents. In July 2017, CreateNYC Plan for the city’s five boroughs, 
                    was released. One of the unusual actions initiated was
                    to tie funding to diversity plans, “DCLA will introduce new diversity measures for our 
                    city's cultural organizations including collecting data from grantees about the diversity 
                    of staff and board members; asking for organizations'
                    approaches to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); and in FY 2019 will require DEI 
                    plans from the Cultural Institutions Group - 33 members whose institutions are on city-owned 
                    property. They receive significant capital and operating
                    support from NYC to help meet basic security, maintenance, administration and energy costs. 
                    In return for this support, these institutions operate as publicly-owned facilities whose 
                    mandate is to provide cultural services accessible to all New Yorkers.</p>

                <p>--somewhat placeholder text ----Who can continue to change museums and in what direction? Looking at 
                representational diversity here is only a part of the conversation about museums. What it does indicate 
                is that museums are not equitable.
                    <br> Does the model of the art museum with power at the top a model that needs to be rethought? And 
                    if so, by whom, those in these institutions or by those who are not at present included in art museums? <br> 
                    NYC DCLA initiated an
                    interesting funding requirement with the DEI plan. Initiatives, social inclusion, activities to promote 
                    museums as social hubs and communities are growing. Most importantly, there are funding efforts to support 
                    paid fellowships, paid
                    internships, training, and mentoring of staff to help open these positions to everyone. And there are 
                    ongoing school education programs to bring young people into museums as a part of their everyday experience.<br> 
                    And critically,
                    what do people who are excluded, the majority who do not visit their local art museum, envisage? If the local 
                    museum was their space, all our spaces, a place that we all equally owned, what do we want to change? limited background.
                    By looking at museum audience demographics, and who the curatorial and leadership staff are, and the artwork 
                    collection datasets, information and trends appear. This project aims to look at details in light of larger conversations
                    around contemporary art museums.</p>
                <p>Availability of open data limits possible findings to inferences, however by bringing together related sets of 
                information, the aim is to create a richer sense of demographics, who is doing what, and, to an extent, what is changing.</p>
