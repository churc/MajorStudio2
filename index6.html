        <h4 class="textblockleft">7,346 paid museum staff, plus board members, work at NYC museums with budgets 
                    larger than $1 million. The 2015 Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) survey identified staff by 22 job types and 
                    grouped by 2010 U.S. Census race and ethnicity categories. Museum staff numbers by race and 
                    ethnicity can be seen along the horizontal axis - each yellow circle shows the number for each job type.<br>
                    Numbers tell one part of the story, by clicking the percent button, percentages horizontally by race and 
                    ethnicity can be seen. 38.36% of paid museum staff and board members 
                    at these larger museums (2,817 people) identify as people of color - compared to 66.7% of the NYC population at that time.
                    The findings from Ithaka S+R and funding partner, The Andrew W. Mellon 
                    Foundation, had a big impact on the city’s cultural community. Following the
                    report, the DCLA</h4> 
                   <h4 class="textblockright">  initiated a cultural plan, reaching out to hear priorities, concerns, and ideas across the 
                   boroughs from nearly 200,000 local residents, and July 2017, released CreateNYC Plan.
                    One of the unusual actions was to tie funding to diversity plans, “DCLA will 
                    introduce new diversity measures for our city's cultural organizations including collecting data from grantees 
                    about the diversity of staff and board members; asking for organizations'
                    approaches to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); and in FY 2019 will require DEI 
                    plans from the CIG" - the Cultural Institutions Group, 33 members whose institutions are on city-owned 
                    property (including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Brooklyn Museum.) These institutions operate as 
                    publicly-owned facilities whose mandate is to provide cultural services accessible to all New Yorkers.

        <h4 class="textblockleft">Brooklyn Museum artworks by nationality of artist. Artworks tend to 
        be recorded by artist name, nationality, and title, date, medium, size, acquisition date, and 
        other categories linked to that object. <br>776 artworks do not have an entry for artist nationality 
        while other entries contain more granularity. <br>60 nationalities are 
        recorded with another 39 varied groupings where, for instance, an artist is noted as from one country 
        and born in another country.<h4> 
      <h4 class="textblockright">The second charts divide the collection into artworks acquired before 
      	2015 (9,961) and 2015-March 2019 (289); 3 are undated.
        Colors indicate continents - in the last five years, 9 artworks by artists from Asia, 20 from Latin 
        America and the Caribbean, 116 from Europe, 116 from Northern America have been acquired, but 
        none by artists from 
        the continent of Africa. American artworks comprise 40.14% of recent acquisitions,
        prior to 2015 this figure was over 68%.

               <h4 class="textblockleft">Who are museums for? Looking at representational diversity here is just a part of the conversation about museums, and
                    museums are not only artworks, staff, and audiences, but also a myriad of intersecting parts: buildings, budgets,
                    history, culture, and exhibitions. Art museums are institutions that collect, curate, and exhibit works of 
                    art, and in doing so contribute to interpreting and shaping our pluralistic culture. <br>
                    Availability of open data here limits possible findings to inferences; these related sets of 
                    information</h4>
                    <h4 class="textblockright">indicate stories. People are writing about art 
                    institutions and rethinking what they can be. How do those 
                    who are not included in museums envisage for art museums? <br>
                    Thank you to all those who have contributed to this including very generous interviewees, and to all the fantastic
                    input from staff at Parsons, without which this project would not have been realized. 
                    In addition, this work relies on surveys undertaken in the field for which I am grateful, and sources are noted below.
